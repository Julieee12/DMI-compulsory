Welcome to Dunder Mifflin Infinity! You are about to see the most excellent webshop ever created!

!!!IMPORTANT!!
Please ignore the "dmifrontend" directory since I failed to delete it. The client directory is "frontend".

I added a postgres dump.sql file in the hopes that the database data could be opened after cloning the repository. I have no idea if this actually works, but I hope it does.

From the home page simply navigate to "Michael Scott" to use administator like features or "Customer" to use customer like features. The admin path will lead you to some sort of dashboard where you can create and see products and customers, edit some data regarding orders and products and view a complete order history of all customers. If you choose the customer path, simply click on a customer's name in the table and that will lead to that specific customer's detail page where an order history is present and also the possibility of placing a new order. In the page for placing orders, you can see a list of products that can be filtered and a search bar. 

When creating customers,orders or products there is no confirmation that they have been created, so just reload the page and they will show up (sorry).

All advertisments on the website are interactive and the website looks bad on purpose!

Everything runs locally!
